                <h2>Christ the Redeemer</h2>
                <p>The statue of Christ the Redeemer has become a symbolic protector of people. Like Jesus Christ, the
                    statue protects the urban environment, like a roof over your head. Cristo Redentor is as important
                    as any shelter. ... The Christ the Redeemer statue was designed by Brazilian engineer and architect
                    Heitor da Silva Costa.</p>

                <h2>Pyramid</h2>
                <p>A pyramid is a structure whose outer surfaces are triangular and converge to a single step at the
                    top, making the shape roughly a pyramid in the geometric sense. The base of a pyramid can be
                    trilateral, quadrilateral, or of any polygon shape. As such, a pyramid has at least three outer
                    triangular surfaces</p>

                <h2>Machu Picchu</h2>
                <p>Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba River
                    valley. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, itâ€™s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone
                    walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on
                    astronomical alignments and panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.</p>

                <h2>Petra</h2>
                <p>Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern desert. Dating to around 300 B.C., it
                    was the capital of the Nabatean Kingdom. Accessed via a narrow canyon called Al Siq, it contains
                    tombs and temples carved into pink sandstone cliffs, earning its nickname, the "Rose City." Perhaps
                    its most famous structure is 45m-high Al Khazneh, a temple with an ornate, Greek-style facade, and
                    known as The Treasury</p>
